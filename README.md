# downloads_notes_from_clearnote

<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;A python crawler downloads notes from clearnotebooks.com <br><br>


&nbsp; &nbsp;choose one note you like on www.clearnotebooks.com<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;the note_id is on the tail of the note's url<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;like this :<br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;https://www.clearnotebooks.com/zh-TW/notebooks/737837<br>
 
&nbsp; &nbsp;and the note_id is 737837<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;input the note_id and the crawler will help you download all of pages in ".jpg" image file<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;and it will build new folder by the tag from clearnote website <br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;it make notes more easy to sort out<br>
<br>


&nbsp; &nbsp;why we need the crawler : <br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;beacause it is too slow viewing notes on thier website<br>
